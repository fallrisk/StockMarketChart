# Stock Market Chart

http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/chart-the-stock-market/

## User Stories (Requirements)
* User Story: I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
* User Story: I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
* User Story: I can remove stocks.
* User Story: I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.

## Setup
This project was done in WebStorm 11.0.3 with no file watchers. I used the current version of
Javascript to make it easier to debug in WebStorm. It's easier because I don't have to deal with
source-maps.
